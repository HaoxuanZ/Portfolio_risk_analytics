Volatility Trading Strategies using VIX and Gold.
Introduction:

For this project, the goal is to find out the performance of US Equity, Gold, and VIX during different periods. We want to figure out between Gold and VIX, which one is a better hedge for US Equity. To conduct the analysis, we used data from 01/01/2007 until 03/31/2020. S&P 500 (Ticker: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq (Ticker: ^IXIC) was chosen to represent the US Equity. Gold (Ticker: GLD) and VIX (Ticker: ^VIX) data is also collected for the project. 
 
focused on three periods:

•	2007-2009 Bear market (01/01/2007 to 03/31/2009)

•	2009-2020 Bull market (03/31/2009 to 01/31/2020)

•	Covid-19 Pandemic (02/01/2020 to 03/31/2020)
