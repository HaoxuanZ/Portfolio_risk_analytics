**Volatility Trading Strategies using VIX and Gold.**

**Introduction:**

For this project, the goal is to find out the performance of US Equity, Gold, and VIX during different periods. We want to figure out between Gold and VIX, which one is a better hedge for US Equity. To conduct the analysis, we used data from 01/01/2007 until 03/31/2020. S&P 500 (Ticker: \^GSPC) and Nasdaq (Ticker: \^IXIC) was chosen to represent the US Equity. Gold (Ticker: GLD) and VIX (Ticker: \^VIX) data is also collected for the project.

For this project, we focused on three periods:

    -   2007-2009 Bear market (01/01/2007 to 03/31/2009)
    -   2009-2020 Bull market (03/31/2009 to 01/31/2020)
    -   Covid-19 Pandemic (02/01/2020 to 03/31/2020)
**Performance of each asset:**

To begin with, we will take a look at the cumulative performance of the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Gold for the period from 01/01/2007 to 03/31/2020.

Graph 1: Cumulative performance of S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Gold, from 01/01/2007 to 03/31/2020.

From the graph1, we can see that Nasdaq achieved the best performance among the three since it had the highest cumulative return of 220.8%, from the beginning of 2007 to the end of March of 2020. Gold reached the second-highest cumulative return of 145.5% and the S&P 500 had the lowest cumulative return of 85.4%.

Graph 2: Cumulative performance of S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Gold, from 01/01/2007 to 03/31/2009.

From Graph 2,during the Global Financial Crisis, Gold which relies on it unique financial attribute achieved the highest cumulative return of 44.5%. Nevertheless, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq had losses because of the crisis. S&P500 lost 44.4% of its value and Nasdaq lost 38.0% of its value. Therefore, we can see that both equity indexes suffered from the crisis. However, Gold managed to hedge the risk of the poor performance of the stock market.

Graph 3: Cumulative performance of S&P500, Nasdaq, and Gold, from 03/31/2009 to 01/31/2020.

2009 - 2020 is the best year of American market. This historical long term bull market leads American economy to climax. We can see Nasdaq reaches its very best cumulative performance. It has the highest cumulative return which is 498.7%. S&P500 also reached to 304.3% cumulative return. However, gold market only had a flat performance which demonstrated it special financial attribute to the Nasdaq and S&P500.

Finally, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, both Nasdaq and S&P 500 plunged in February and March. Nasdaq lost 16.2% of its value and S&P 500 lost 19.2% of its value. The performance of Gold was relatively more stable than the other two, ending up with a return of 3.1%.
